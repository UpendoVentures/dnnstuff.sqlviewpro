Skins
-----

Skins or Themes in SQLView Pro are located in the folder
**DesktopModules\\DNNStuff - SQLViewPro\\Skins**. Each skin has it's own
folder and the folder contains at a minimum a **styles.css** file, but
can also contain images or anything else necessary for the skin.

### Create your own skin

1.  Copy one of the existing skin folders to a new name. For instance
    copy the **Red** folder to a new name such as **MySkin**
2.  Go into the newly created folder **MySkin** and edit the
    **styles.css** file.
3.  The selector names have to match the new skin name, so change all
    occurrences of **Red\_** with **MySkin\_** and save your file
4.  Now, if you go into a SQLView Pro reportset or a report, in the
    theme dropdown you should see your new skin show up. All we've done
    at this point is copy an existing skin and haven't made any changes
    to the styles so it will still look like the **Red** skin.
5.  Go back and edit the **styles.css** file in your new skin and make
    changes to any of the styles and save the file and you'll see those
    changes reflected on your reports, parameters, reportset, grids etc.
