# SQLView Pro Connections 

## Edit Connections

The connections screen is where you must predefine any connections that
you will be using when querying data. This central screen for managing
connections will enable you to set your connection data once and then
use it in all of your reports.

**Please note that you do not need to set up a connection to your
current DNN database.** This connection will be presented automatically
in all connection selection lists. You will only need to add connections
if you wish to retrieve data from external databases other than your DNN
database.
